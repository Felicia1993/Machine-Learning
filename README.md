#### Hierarchical clustering
Hierarchical clustering: Cluster have a tree like structure or a parent child relationship 
- Agglomerative: Bottom up approach: Begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively larger cluster 
- Divisive: Top Down approach begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it successively smaller clusters. 
#### Partitional clustering 
- K-Means: Division of objects into clusters such that each object is in exactly one cluster, not several  
- Fuzzy C-Means: Division of objects into clusters such that each object can belong to multiple clusters.
### Distance Measure 
Distance Measure: distance measure will determine the similarity between two elements and it will influence the shape the clusters 
- Euclidean distance measure: is the ordinary straight line. It is the distance between two points in Euclidean space
- Squared Euclidean distance measure: matric uses the same equation as the Euclidean distance but does not take the square root.
- Manhattan distance measure: is the simple sum of the horizontal and vertical components or the distance between two points along axes at right angles.  
- Cosine distance measure: similarity measures the angle between the two vectors.
